During the process of learning and exploring AWS services, I have also translated several blogs to enhance my knowledge:

###  [Blog 1 - How a Customer Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) by 28% for Storage with Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog explains how a multi-branch organization optimized its storage using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. The architecture leverages **FlexCache, SnapMirror, and Multi-AZ** to improve access performance, simplify operations, and **reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by 28%** compared to on-premises solutions.

###  [Blog 2 - Automating Vector Embedding Generation in Aurora PostgreSQL with Bedrock](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog guides on how to automatically generate vector embeddings for PostgreSQL data using **Aurora + pgvector + Bedrock**. It presents multiple strategies (triggers, synchronous/asynchronous Lambda, SQS batch processing, pg_cron), analyzing their pros and cons in terms of **latency, synchronization, scalability**, and provides guidance on designing an optimal embedding pipeline for AI applications.

###  [Blog 3 - Grouping Database Tables under AWS Database Migration Service Tasks for PostgreSQL Source Engine](3.3-Blog3/)
This blog explains how to analyze PostgreSQL metadata and table characteristics to group tables effectively into **AWS DMS tasks**. It guides on **load balancing, reducing CDC latency**, handling large tables, LOB columns, or tables without PK/UK, and shares best practices for performing large-scale database migrations efficiently.
