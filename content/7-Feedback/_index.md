>Here you can freely share your personal opinions regarding your experiences participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve on shortcomings based on the following categories:

### General Evaluation

**1. Working Environment** The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always ready to support me when I face difficulties, even outside of working hours. The workspace is organized and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think adding some social sessions or knowledge-based games during the learning process would help everyone understand each other better and learn from one another more effectively.

**2. Support from Mentors / Team Admin** The mentors provide very detailed guidance, explaining clearly when I don't understand, and always encouraging me to ask questions. The Team Admin supports administrative procedures and documentation, creating favorable conditions for me to work. The mentors do not just answer technical questions but also guide my problem-solving mindset. I highly appreciate that the mentors allow me to try and handle problems myself instead of just giving the answers.

**3. Alignment between Work and Major** As an AI major student, participating in FCJ and diving deep into AWS Cloud is a perfect complement to my career path. The assigned work not only helps reinforce foundational knowledge of Programming/Data but also opens up a new mindset regarding infrastructure and real-world application deployment.

**4. Opportunities for Learning & Skill Development** During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Mentors also shared a lot of practical experience to help me better orient my career. The real-world experiences shared by Mentors are invaluable lessons that schools can hardly provide enough of.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit** The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but maintains a cheerful atmosphere. When there are urgent projects, everyone strives together, sharing and supporting regardless of position. This makes me feel like part of the collective, even though I am just an intern.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns** The company has very fair support policies for interns, from allowances to flexibility in working hours to balance studies. In particular, the greatest value I received was participating in internal training sessions and knowledge-sharing workshops.


### Other Questions
- What satisfied you **the most** during the internship?  
It was receiving wholehearted support from the mentors and team members on my journey to the cloud from zero. Although this journey was somewhat difficult, thanks to that sharing and assistance, I gradually improved and learned many new things crucial for my future career.
- What do you think the company **needs to improve** for future interns?  
I think there should be a specific roadmap so that interns can research and learn faster; many get lost researching forever and lose direction, not knowing what they are doing.
- If introducing this to friends, would you **recommend they intern here**? Why?  
I would introduce my friends. Because this is an ideal environment to transform textbook knowledge into battle-tested skills to deploy ideas into products. If my friends want to truly understand what "doing Cloud" is like, rather than just theory, FCJ is the best starting point.

### Suggestions & Wishes
- Do you have any suggestions to improve the experience during the internship?  
- Do you want to continue this program in the future? I really hope to have the opportunity to continue accompanying the company.
- Other feedback (feel free to share): I would like to send my sincere thanks to the Mentors and the FCJ Team for patiently and dedicatedly guiding me over the past 3 months. The First Cloud Journey gave me not only knowledge but also the confidence to pursue a professional Cloud & AI Engineering path.
