# Building an AI Agent with AWS Bedrock

#### Overview

**Amazon Bedrock** is a fully managed AI/ML service provided by AWS, allowing businesses to easily access and utilize foundational models such as Claude, Llama, Stable Diffusion, Amazon Titan, and others without the need to build complex AI infrastructure.

We can call these models through the Bedrock API or Bedrock console without having to deploy AI infrastructure ourselves.
